                    <h2>Object</h2>
                    <p>Make lines of tiles that are either all one color or all
                        one shape. Points are scored for every tile played.
                        The player with the most points wins the game.</p>
                    <h2>Setup</h2>
                    <p>Each game generates a random sequence of tiles.
                        Qwirkle normally does not use any boards. The
                        grey squares added after each move indicate
                        valid positions to assist the player.</p>
                    <h2>Starting the game</h2>
                    <p>Each player gets six tiles to create his or her deck.
                        The player sees his tiles on the bottom of his
                        screen. You may choose who starts first (you or
                        the computer). Start playing by placing tiles that
                        match color or shape. The tiles must be placed at
                        one direction.</p>

                    <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
                    <p>On your turn:
                        1. Place one or more tiles.
                        2. Press submit when done.
                        3. Random tiles will automatically fill your bag to
                        bring your deck back up to six (after each "submit").</p>
                    <p>If you can’t or don’t want to place tiles, you may
                        exchange tiles instead by dragging them to the bag.
                        This counts as your entire turn and you do not
                        score any points. Drag to the bag all the tiles you
                        want to discard and press "submit". You will get the
                        same number of random tiles as replacement tiles.
                        You cannot discard more tiles than the amount of
                        tiles left in the bag.</p>
                    <h2>Placing Tiles</h2>
                    <p>You may play multiple tiles on your turn as long as
                        all played tiles are of the same color or shape,
                        and placed in the same line. You cannot play two
                        tiles that are exactly the same.</p>
                    <p>At least one of the tiles you play must touch
                        (side to side) a tile that has already been played
                        and match the tile in color or shape. Any tiles
                        that touch each other are part of a line. Lines are
                        either all of one shape or one color without any
                        duplicates.</p>

                    <p>There can be no duplicate tiles in a line. For example,
                        a line of squares can only have one blue square.

                        A line can never be longer than six tiles. As the
                        game progresses, spaces will be created between
                        played tiles, where no other tiles can be played.</p>

                    <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Play your tiles so that they are part of more than one line.</li>
                        <li>Save tiles that can help you make a Qwirkle.</li>
                        <li>Avoid creating places for other players to make a Qwirkle.</li>
                        <li>Remember that there are three of each type of tile.</li>
